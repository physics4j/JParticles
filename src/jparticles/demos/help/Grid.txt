<h2>Description</h2>
This object is constructed by adding stretch and bending potentials along the grid structure formed by the white links.

<h2>Controls</h2>
<b><i>Viscosity field</i></b>: Set the value for the medium viscosity.
Don't forget to press the return key to activate the new value.
<p><b><i>Time-step field</i></b>: Set the value for the time step.
Don't forget to press the return key to activate the new value.</p>
<p><b><i>Particles</i></b>: The yellow particles are free to move.
The red ones are fixed. To fix-release a particle, press the right mouse button while
the mouse pointer is over the particle. To move a particle drag the mouse while holding its left button.</p>
<p><b><i>Left slider</i></b>: Controls the stiffness of the stretch potential.</p>
<p><b><i>Right slider</i></b>: Controls the stiffness of the bending potential.</p>
<p><b><i>Space Bar</i></b>: Toggle Stop/Start the animation.</p>
