<h2>Description</h2>

This applet shows a snake in a potential field. Snakes are used in computer vision to localise features.
For example the spatial potential could be generated by the gray level edges of a face image.
The snake could then be used to localise features like: nose, mouth, etc.

<h2>Controls</h2>

<b><i>Viscosity</b></i> : Set the value for the medium viscosity in here.
Don't forget to press the return key to activate the new value.

<p><b><i>Time-step</b></i>: Set the value for the time step in here.
Don't forget to press the return key to activate the new value.</p>

<p><b><i>Particles</b></i>: The yellow particles are free to move. The red ones are fixed.
To fix-release a particle, press the right mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the particle.
To move a particle drag the mouse while holding its left button.</p>

<p><b><i>Left slider</b></i>: Controls the stiffness of the stretch potential.</p>

<p><b><i>Right slider</b></i>: Controls the stiffness of the bending potential.</p>
