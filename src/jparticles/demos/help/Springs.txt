<h2>Description</h2>

This applet shows of a circular chain of particles, each of which is attached to an outer fixed particle
by means of a spring. Drag the red particles with the mouse.
By right clicking on a particle you can alternate its state from fixed (red color) to free (orange color).
Experiment by changing the viscosity and the time increment
(don't forget to press return after changing the value)

<h2>Controls</h2>

<b><i>Viscosity</i></b> : Set the value for the medium viscosity.
Don't forget to press the return key to activate the new value.

<p><b><i>Time-step </i></b>: Set the value for the time step. Don't forget to press the
return key to activate the new value.</p>

<p><b><i>Particles</i></b>: The yellow particles are free to move. The red ones are fixed.
To fix-release a particle, press the right mouse button while the mouse pointer is over the particle.
To move a particle, drag it with the mouse while holding the left button.</p>

<p><b><i>Slider</i></b>: Controls the stiffness of the springs joining the particles.</p>

<p><b><i>Space Bar</i></b>: Toggle Stop/Start the animation.</p>
