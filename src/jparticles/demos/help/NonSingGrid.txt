<h2> Description</h2>
This structure is composed of three types of potential: stretch potential, bend potential and non-singular potential.
The no-singular potential is used to avoid folds of the grid structure. To see the effect,
move the left slider to the right end. See how the grid folds. To correct this, move the right slider to the right end.
